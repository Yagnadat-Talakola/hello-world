# hello-world
Welcome world! - Getting started with the exciting world of sharing and collaborating.
I am Yagnadat, living in Minneapolis, MN for few months now. I am pursuing Foundations of Data Science workshop at Springboard and I am having a great time learning exciting stuff. I look forward to working with exciting sets of data and analyzing interesting trends. Hopefully build better data products that all of us can freely use.
